The OpenFlexure Delta Stage uses 3 motors to control a delta flexure mechanism. 

DeltaStageController.ino provides a serial interface to control the Delta stage using cartesian coordinates.

MicroMetal.ino - provides a serial interface to control the modified delta stage which uses Micro Metal DC motors with quadrature encoders.
